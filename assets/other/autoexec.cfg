volume "0.2" //This setting is the general volume slider for all sound. You can adjust it up to "1" according to your own preference

voice_enable "1" // This enables voicechat with other players. If you set it to "0" you disable the voice chat.

voice_scale "0.2" // This value determines how loud your player’s communication will be played. You can freely adjust this between "0" and "1" but if you put a higher value on it, you won’t hear as much game sounds as long as a teammate is talking.

snd_surround_speakers "0" // This setting disables your surround speaker configuration

snd_tensecondwarning_volume "1" // This is a setting you should keep on the default level. This activates your music kit in the last 10 seconds of a planted bomb. This way you can easily determine if it is still possible to go for a defuse or not.
